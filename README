This is the source files I found of interest from WANem (http://wanem.sourceforge.net/). 

I have uploaded these file as whilst the WANem site states that it is GPL, the source was not available in Sourceforge's repositories.

I hope to produce a revised version of WANem which can be applied to any Linux distribution with the necessary dependencies.
